Data:

Juliaset- 
Not sure if this is the right graph...
But these are the high resolution juliaset jpg files produced with (0-1i) as the complex number. The original_juliaset.jpg contains the image without zooming. I zoomed in on interesting portions. Each graph shows black specs off the contained black regions. At these complex numbers in the plane, 0 iterations were needed for the magnitude to be greater than 2. 

Mandelbrot-
Here are the high resolution mandelbrot jpg files produced with the given inputs. The original_mandelbrot.jpg contains the image without zooming. I zoomed in on interesting portions. The zoom2_mandelbrot shows black specs off the contained black regions. At these complex numbers in the plane, 0 iterations were needed for the magnitude to be greater than 2.
